    "summary": "As frontier AI advances rapidly, understanding its impact on cybersecurity\nand inherent risks is essential to ensuring safe AI evolution (e.g., guiding\nrisk mitigation and informing policymakers). While some studies review AI\napplications in cybersecurity, none of them comprehensively discuss AI's future\nimpacts or provide concrete recommendations for navigating its safe and secure\nusage. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of frontier AI's impact on\ncybersecurity and establishes a systematic framework for risk assessment and\nmitigation. To this end, we first define and categorize the marginal risks of\nfrontier AI in cybersecurity and then systemically analyze the current and\nfuture impacts of frontier AI in cybersecurity, qualitatively and\nquantitatively. We also discuss why frontier AI likely benefits attackers more\nthan defenders in the short term from equivalence classes, asymmetry, and\neconomic impact. Next, we explore frontier AI's impact on future software\nsystem development, including enabling complex hybrid systems while introducing\nnew risks. Based on our findings, we provide security recommendations,\nincluding constructing fine-grained benchmarks for risk assessment, designing\nAI agents for defenses, building security mechanisms and provable defenses for\nhybrid systems, enhancing pre-deployment security testing and transparency, and\nstrengthening defenses for users. Finally, we present long-term research\nquestions essential for understanding AI's future impacts and unleashing its\ndefensive capabilities.",

    "summary": "In the vast domain of cybersecurity, the transition from reactive defense to\noffensive has become critical in protecting digital infrastructures. This paper\nexplores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into offensive\ncybersecurity, particularly through the development of an autonomous AI agent,\nReaperAI, designed to simulate and execute cyberattacks. Leveraging the\ncapabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, ReaperAI\ndemonstrates the potential to identify, exploit, and analyze security\nvulnerabilities autonomously.\n  This research outlines the core methodologies that can be utilized to\nincrease consistency and performance, including task-driven penetration testing\nframeworks, AI-driven command generation, and advanced prompting techniques.\nThe AI agent operates within a structured environment using Python, enhanced by\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for contextual understanding and memory\nretention. ReaperAI was tested on platforms including, Hack The Box, where it\nsuccessfully exploited known vulnerabilities, demonstrating its potential\npower.\n  However, the deployment of AI in offensive security presents significant\nethical and operational challenges. The agent's development process revealed\ncomplexities in command execution, error handling, and maintaining ethical\nconstraints, highlighting areas for future enhancement.\n  This study contributes to the discussion on AI's role in cybersecurity by\nshowcasing how AI can augment offensive security strategies. It also proposes\nfuture research directions, including the refinement of AI interactions with\ncybersecurity tools, enhancement of learning mechanisms, and the discussion of\nethical guidelines for AI in offensive roles. The findings advocate for a\nunique approach to AI implementation in cybersecurity, emphasizing innovation.",

    "summary": "The dual use nature of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a growing\nchallenge in cybersecurity. While LLM enhances automation and reasoning for\ndefenders, they also introduce new risks, particularly their potential to be\nmisused for generating evasive, AI crafted malware. Despite this emerging\nthreat, the research community currently lacks controlled and extensible tools\nthat can simulate such behavior for testing and defense preparation. We present\nMalGEN, a multi agent framework that simulates coordinated adversarial behavior\nto generate diverse, activity driven malware samples. The agents work\ncollaboratively to emulate attacker workflows, including payload planning,\ncapability selection, and evasion strategies, within a controlled environment\nbuilt for ethical and defensive research. Using MalGEN, we synthesized ten\nnovel malware samples and evaluated them against leading antivirus and\nbehavioral detection engines. Several samples exhibited stealthy and evasive\ncharacteristics that bypassed current defenses, validating MalGEN's ability to\nmodel sophisticated and new threats. By transforming the threat of LLM misuse\ninto an opportunity for proactive defense, MalGEN offers a valuable framework\nfor evaluating and strengthening cybersecurity systems. The framework addresses\ndata scarcity, enables rigorous testing, and supports the development of\nresilient and future ready detection strategies.",

    "summary": "In an era marked by unprecedented digital complexity, the cybersecurity\nlandscape is evolving at a breakneck pace, challenging traditional defense\nparadigms. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) reveal inherent vulnerabilities\nin conventional security measures and underscore the urgent need for\ncontinuous, adaptive, and proactive strategies that seamlessly integrate human\ninsight with cutting edge AI technologies. This manuscript explores how the\nconvergence of agentic AI and Frontier AI is transforming cybersecurity by\nreimagining frameworks such as the cyber kill chain, enhancing threat\nintelligence processes, and embedding robust ethical governance within\nautomated response systems. Drawing on real-world data and forward looking\nperspectives, we examine the roles of real time monitoring, automated incident\nresponse, and perpetual learning in forging a resilient, dynamic defense\necosystem. Our vision is to harmonize technological innovation with unwavering\nethical oversight, ensuring that future AI driven security solutions uphold\ncore human values of fairness, transparency, and accountability while\neffectively countering emerging cyber threats.",

    "summary": "Decentralized AI agents will soon interact across internet platforms,\ncreating security challenges beyond traditional cybersecurity and AI safety\nframeworks. Free-form protocols are essential for AI's task generalization but\nenable new threats like secret collusion and coordinated swarm attacks. Network\neffects can rapidly spread privacy breaches, disinformation, jailbreaks, and\ndata poisoning, while multi-agent dispersion and stealth optimization help\nadversaries evade oversightcreating novel persistent threats at a systemic\nlevel. Despite their critical importance, these security challenges remain\nunderstudied, with research fragmented across disparate fields including AI\nsecurity, multi-agent learning, complex systems, cybersecurity, game theory,\ndistributed systems, and technical AI governance. We introduce\n\\textbf{multi-agent security}, a new field dedicated to securing networks of\ndecentralized AI agents against threats that emerge or amplify through their\ninteractionswhether direct or indirect via shared environmentswith each other,\nhumans, and institutions, and characterize fundamental security-performance\ntrade-offs. Our preliminary work (1) taxonomizes the threat landscape arising\nfrom interacting AI agents, (2) surveys security-performance tradeoffs in\ndecentralized AI systems, and (3) proposes a unified research agenda addressing\nopen challenges in designing secure agent systems and interaction environments.\nBy identifying these gaps, we aim to guide research in this critical area to\nunlock the socioeconomic potential of large-scale agent deployment on the\ninternet, foster public trust, and mitigate national security risks in critical\ninfrastructure and defense contexts.",

    "summary": "Open-ended learning (OEL) -- which emphasizes training agents that achieve\nbroad capability over narrow competency -- is emerging as a paradigm to develop\nartificial intelligence (AI) agents to achieve robustness and generalization.\nHowever, despite promising results that demonstrate the benefits of OEL,\napplying OEL to develop autonomous agents for real-world cybersecurity\napplications remains a challenge.\n  We propose a training approach, inspired by OEL, to develop autonomous\nnetwork defenders. Our results demonstrate that like in other domains, OEL\nprinciples can translate into more robust and generalizable agents for cyber\ndefense. To apply OEL to network defense, it is necessary to address several\ntechnical challenges. Most importantly, it is critical to provide a task\nrepresentation approach over a broad universe of tasks that maintains a\nconsistent interface over goals, rewards and action spaces. This way, the\nlearning agent can train with varying network conditions, attacker behaviors,\nand defender goals while being able to build on previously gained knowledge.\n  With our tools and results, we aim to fundamentally impact research that\napplies AI to solve cybersecurity problems. Specifically, as researchers\ndevelop gyms and benchmarks for cyber defense, it is paramount that they\nconsider diverse tasks with consistent representations, such as those we\npropose in our work.",

    "summary": "We investigate the scale of attack and defense mathematically in the context\nof AI's possible effect on cybersecurity. For a given target today, highly\nscaled cyber attacks such as from worms or botnets typically all fail or all\nsucceed. Here, we consider the effect of scale if those attack agents were\nintelligent and creative enough to act independently such that each attack\nattempt was different from the others or such that attackers could learn from\ntheir successes and failures. We find that small increases in the number or\nquality of defenses can compensate for exponential increases in the number of\nindependent attacks and for exponential speedups.",

    "summary": "The dawn of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), characterized by\nadvanced models such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) and other\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), has been pivotal in reshaping the field of data\nanalysis, pattern recognition, and decision-making processes. This surge in GAI\ntechnology has ushered in not only innovative opportunities for data processing\nand automation but has also introduced significant cybersecurity challenges.\n  As GAI rapidly progresses, it outstrips the current pace of cybersecurity\nprotocols and regulatory frameworks, leading to a paradox wherein the same\ninnovations meant to safeguard digital infrastructures also enhance the arsenal\navailable to cyber criminals. These adversaries, adept at swiftly integrating\nand exploiting emerging technologies, may utilize GAI to develop malware that\nis both more covert and adaptable, thus complicating traditional cybersecurity\nefforts.\n  The acceleration of GAI presents an ambiguous frontier for cybersecurity\nexperts, offering potent tools for threat detection and response, while\nconcurrently providing cyber attackers with the means to engineer more\nintricate and potent malware. Through the joint efforts of Duke Pratt School of\nEngineering, Coalfire, and Safebreach, this research undertakes a meticulous\nanalysis of how malicious agents are exploiting GAI to augment their attack\nstrategies, emphasizing a critical issue for the integrity of future\ncybersecurity initiatives. The study highlights the critical need for\norganizations to proactively identify and develop more complex defensive\nstrategies to counter the sophisticated employment of GAI in malware creation.",

At the same\ntime, it has exposed how quickly adversaries can propagate through the network.\nWhile research has greatly progressed on quality decoy generation to fool human\nadversaries, we may need different strategies to slow computer agents. In this\npaper, we show that decoy generation can slow an automated agent's decision\nprocess, but that the degree to which it is inhibited is greatly dependent on\nthe types of objects used. This points to the need to explicitly evaluate decoy\ngeneration and placement strategies against fast moving, automated adversaries.",
